### Negative points about watching anime

Before talking more about the project, I would like to point out some negative points in using free time to watch anime.
1. Screen time, especially at night, is linked to poor sleep (Source: https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/blue-light-health)
2. Poor Sitting, Standing and Screen Time Posture Can Lead to Discomfort (Source: https://loudounsportstherapy.com/11-16-posture )
